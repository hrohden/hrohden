### Hi there, I'm Henrique Broering Rohden

I am a full-stack Java developer and open source contribuitor. I love working with all Java-related technologies, such as Spring and JPA (Hibernate), as well as frontend libraries and frameworks, included (but not limited to) Angular, React and even vanilla Javascript.
